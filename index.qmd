## What is Locimapper?

Locimapper is a pluggable data mapping and validation platform that allows organizations to integrate a hosted Import and Validation experience directly within their own applications. It provides a secure, branded, and intuitive interface for uploading, mapping, and validating data before it enters your system without requiring you to build those complex workflows yourself.

### How It Works

Locimapper is designed to be modular and integration-friendly. Developers can connect their applications through APIs and launch a fully hosted mapping and validation page. Users can then review, match, and validate their data through a guided process, and Locimapper automatically returns clean, structured data back to your application.

### Typical Flow

1. In Developer Settings, create an application to obtain your Client ID and Client Secret.  
2. Set up an Integration, which defines how Locimapper will interact with your data schema and redirect settings.  
3. From your backend, send a launch request to Locimapper to generate a session link.  
4. Open the returned frontend URL inside your product, for example, within a 900×700 pixel modal window or a dedicated page.  
5. After your users complete the mapping and validation process, Locimapper securely redirects them back to your configured redirect URL with a status code and relevant metadata.
