## What is SmartSchema?

SmartSchema is a pluggable data mapping and validation platform that allows organizations to integrate a hosted Import and Validation experience directly within their own applications. It provides a secure, branded, and intuitive interface for uploading, mapping, and validating data before it enters your system without requiring you to build those complex workflows yourself.

### How It Works

SmartSchema is designed to be modular and integration-friendly. Developers can connect their applications through APIs and launch a fully hosted mapping and validation page. Users can then review, match, and validate their data through a guided process, and SmartSchema automatically returns clean, structured data back to your application.

### Typical Flow

1. In Developer Settings, create an application to obtain your Client ID and Client Secret.  
2. Set up an Integration, which defines how SmartSchema will interact with your data schema and redirect settings.  
3. From your backend, send a launch request to SmartSchema to generate a session link.  
4. Open the returned frontend URL inside your product, for example, within a 900×700 pixel modal window or a dedicated page.  
5. After your users complete the mapping and validation process, SmartSchema securely redirects them back to your configured redirect URL with a status code and relevant metadata.

### Why SmartSchema?

SmartSchema simplifies the most complex parts of data onboarding and validation through features such as:

- AI-powered column mapping that intelligently matches uploaded file columns with your internal schema.  
- Custom validation rules to enforce data type, range, uniqueness, and required field constraints.  
- Secure data handling with token-based authentication and API access control.  
- Seamless embedding that fits naturally within your existing application using iframe or full-page views.  
- Branding options that allow you to align the hosted pages with your product’s design and color palette.  
- Scalable architecture that supports teams, multiple accounts, and complex integration scenarios.
