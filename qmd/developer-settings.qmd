## Create an App Credentials

After logging in at [locimapper.com](https://locimapper.com), you can create an application credential that connects your system to the Locimapper platform.

1. Go to **Side menu → Developer Settings**  

2. Under **Credentials** tab click **Create credential** to create a new application.  

3. Configure **Branding** to match your product’s style and colors.  
   This makes your hosted import and validation pages look native.
