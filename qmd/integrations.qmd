## Create an Integration

From the **Developer Settings → Integrations** tab, click **New Integration** to connect Locimapper with an external API or service.  
You’ll be guided through three configuration steps: **Basic**, **Settings**, and **Behavior**.

---

### Step 1: Basic Configuration

1. Select an **App** from your existing Locimapper applications.  
2. Enter a descriptive **Integration Name** (for example, “Salesforce Import”).  
3. Optionally add a **Description** to explain the purpose of this integration.  
4. Choose a **Schema** to define the data structure this integration supports.  
5. Provide a **Redirect URL** — the page your users return to after data submission (for example, `https://yourapp.com/oauth/callback`).

### Step 2: API Settings

In this step, you configure how Locimapper sends validated data to your external service.

1. **API Endpoint** — Enter the destination URL where the data should be delivered.  
   Example:  
   ```json
   https://api.yourservice.com/ingest?param1=foo&param2=bar
   ```

2. **API Headers** — Add authentication and content-type headers that your endpoint requires.  
   Example:  
   ```json
   {
     "Authorization": "Bearer <token>",
     "Content-Type": "application/json"
   }
   ```

3. **Example JSON Request Body** — Once a schema is selected, Locimapper automatically displays a sample JSON payload showing the structure of validated data that will be sent to your API.

4. **HTTP Method** — Choose the method your endpoint expects, such as `POST` or `PUT`.

> These settings define the connection between Locimapper’s data validator and your backend service, ensuring data is transmitted securely and in the expected format.

---

### Step 3: Behavior Settings

Define how data submission should behave when users upload and validate data.

- **Require All Valid Rows** — Blocks submission if any row fails validation.  
- **Allow Partial Submission** — Submits only valid rows, skipping invalid ones.  

This setting provides flexibility depending on whether complete data integrity or partial acceptance is preferred.

---

## Post-Import Redirect

After users complete their import or validation process, Locimapper automatically redirects the browser to the configured **Redirect URL** and appends a `status` query parameter to indicate the result.

**Example**
```json
https://yourapp.com/oauth/callback?status=200
```

> You can use this status code in your backend to confirm a successful submission or handle errors gracefully.
