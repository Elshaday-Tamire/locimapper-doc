## Launch Endpoint

Your backend calls this endpoint to receive a **single-use, short-lived** URL for the hosted Import/Validator page.

### Endpoint
```json
POST https://app.locimapper.com/api/accounts/integrations/launch
```

### Request (JSON)
```json
{
  "client_id": "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
  "client_secret": "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET",
  "integration_id": "YOUR_INTEGRATION_ID"
}
```

You may optionally include an `overrides` object in the launch request to provide per-launch values for templated endpoints and to replace stored headers for that launch. When present, the `overrides` key sits alongside the authentication and integration fields in the same request body.

Example launch request with optional `overrides`:

```json
{
  "client_id": "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
  "client_secret": "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET",
  "integration_id": "YOUR_INTEGRATION_ID",
  "overrides": {
    "user_id": "value",
    "foo": "value",
    "bar": "value",
    "api_header": {
      "Accept": "application/json",
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
      "Authorization": "Bearer abcdef..."
    }
  }
}
```

Notes and validation rules for `overrides`:

- The `overrides` object may contain keys that match placeholders used in the integration's `api_endpoint` template (placeholders are written with curly braces `{}` in the integration). Keys must match placeholder names exactly; unknown keys that are not present in the template will be rejected.
- To replace stored headers for a single launch, include an `api_header` object inside `overrides`; it must be a JSON object mapping header names to string values. The `api_header` override replaces stored headers entirely (no merging).
- `api_header` must contain only string values; non-string header values are rejected.
- If you provide `overrides` for placeholders, you must supply values for all placeholders used in the template; otherwise the request will be rejected.
- Tokens/overrides are validated server-side and invalid shapes or missing values will return a 400 error on launch.
